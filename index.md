# History

The Active 20-30 Club has its beginnings in 1922 when young men in two separate
communities in the US saw the need for a service club for young men. They found
that established service clubs were dominated by older men, run by older men,
and had officers who were invariably older men.

This realization led these ambitious young men to organize clubs of their own.
These new clubs shared the ideal that young people would have a chance to engage
actively in service to their communities; where young ideas and civic
responsibilities, backed by enthusiasm and the energy of youth, could be shared
on an equal basis with clubs comprised of older men.

These pioneers of youth-led service clubs simultaneously created two identical
clubs which later merged to form Active 20-30 International.

# International Affiliations

Active 20-30 USA & Canada is a member of Active 20-30 International and the
World Council of Service Clubs (WOCO). These organizations enable us to reach
children in Europe, Africa, India, North and South America.

# Growing Strong

The Active 20-30 Club has grown from its inception in 1922 to include more than
100 clubs in both hemispheres. As a member of WOCO, Active 20-30 members
participate in international charitable events and share the belief that
children are the future across the globe.

# Traditions

## Bell, Banner & Gavel

Every club in Active 20-30 is issued a "club banner," a brass bell, and a
president's gavel. These are standard items that each club must maintain as an
Active 20-30 club and must be used at all official club meetings. However, a
tradition among many of the clubs is to make sure that no one "steals" these
items from the meeting. Any member may attempt to steal one of these items
during the meeting and then it is returned in some most unusual ways. Even
members visiting from area clubs may attempt to steal one of these items. The
banner belongs to the club. The bell and gavel belong to the current President.
Protect the banner at all costs!! The bell and gavel can be stolen only during
the time it has been rung in until it has been rung out.

## Songs & Pledges

Many of the clubs begin each club meeting with a song or the Pledge of
Allegiance and may end each meeting with a song as well.

## Badges

When a person becomes a member of a club, they are issued an official name badge
with their name and club name engraved. In many clubs, it is a requirement that
each member wear their badge during the meeting.

## Pennies-A-Day

Every meeting you will see a container passed around with money in it. This is
our Pennies-A-Day container. One club member is designated the “Can Carrier” and
he or she is responsible for container. The least you can do for a child is to
donate one penny a day. The money collected will be presented to the Convention
Host Club to be donated back to their community.

## Fines

At most meetings we fine our Members for anything from not wearing your pin and
badge to getting up in the middle of the meeting to wearing a green shirt. All
fines are meant in fun. All fine money is used to purchase a beverage for
prospective members' first visits.
